# opendata
This is a repository for open data sources to use with a JKAN platform

## Advantages

* No hosting costs
* Deals with any file type
* Preview works well for smaller .csv datasets and for geojson datasets
* Files without preview (i.e.too large) give the option to download as a button
* 

## Issues

* Limit on GitHub repo size - not scalable
* Preview will not work for file sizes over a certain size (can't find this limit currently)
* Off-putting to see large files with an error message and the option to View Raw
* Downloading is not intuitive. If previewed then difficult for a new user to work out how to download

## Ideas
* Devon use a separate repo for each category, which allows for a link to download all the data as a zip file using the 'clone or download' button
* If separate repos used for each data category, a README.md file can be automatically displayed with additional instructions
